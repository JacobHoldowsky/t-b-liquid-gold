      <h2>Sponsor a Honey Board</h2>
      <p>
        This year, we have been through very challenging times in Israel. Many
        people are grieving the loss of their loved ones, many are anxiously
        awaiting the return of their loved ones, and many women are alone for
        many months while their husbands are fighting the war. We invite you to
        partner with us and send sweetness and support to our brothers in
        Israel. We created a special board for these families to gift them with
        5 of our unique flavored creamed honeys along with wine and chocolate.
        Please consider sponsoring a honey board, and we will distribute it on
        your behalf. Thank you for helping us spread the sweetness of our honeys
        to the ones who need it most.
      </p>
